1. Project Title / Headline

OLA Analytics Dashboard: Ride Booking, Revenue & Customer Behavior Insights
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze OLA’s ride booking performance—covering demand trends, revenue streams, cancellations, vehicle-wise performance, and customer/driver ratings.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The OLA Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization project built to monitor and evaluate ride-hailing business performance. It helps stakeholders understand booking trends, revenue distribution, cancellation behavior, and service quality across different vehicle categories.

This dashboard is useful for business analysts, operations teams, and product managers who want data-driven insights into mobility platforms like OLA or Uber.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for building interactive dashboards.

📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures such as total revenue, success rate, cancellation rate, averages, etc.

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships between bookings, customers, vehicles, and payments for cross-filtering.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

4. Data Source

Source: Synthetic business dataset modeled on real-world ride-hailing operations (inspired by OLA and Uber).

The dataset captures complete ride transactions, including booking and driver IDs, ride status, vehicle types, booking value, trip distance, payment methods, customer and driver ratings, and detailed cancellation reasons.

It is structured to closely resemble real operational data used by mobility companies, making it suitable for practical business analysis and KPI-driven insights.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms handle massive daily transactions but often struggle with:

Understanding why rides get cancelled

To build an interactive analytics tool that:

Tracks overall business performance

Identifies operational bottlenecks (like cancellations)

Evaluates revenue patterns and customer behavior

Supports data-driven decision-making for growth and optimization
